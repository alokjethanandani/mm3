          Alok is fearless. To take action requires ownership of the outcome. When one takes action, the inevitable conclusion will determine if the decision was either right or wrong. Action requires vulnerability, confidence and conviction.

          Alok, thank you for your commitment to moving projects forward included driving discussion, leading critical thinking and embracing opportunity. Your care for your teammates and passion for "doing amazing things" created a culture of impact. Your humility ensured nothing stood in the way of team progress.

          Alok is a rare individual who brings a lot of passion and enthusiasm to everything he does. He has the intellectual curiosity and technical skills to lead customer development and design efforts. 
          <br><br>
          I had a fantastic time working alongside Alok at Counsyl, where I was constantly impressed by his creativity, dedication and intuition for the customer. From the clarity with which he's able to convey ideas, to his attention to detail in crafting visuals and shipping code, Alok can consistently deliver across the entire lifecycle of a project. He would be an amazing addition to any team.

          Alok is one of the most organized and detail-oriented designers I’ve worked with, and was able to bring a high level of process and methodology to our in-house design group. I was Alok’s direct manager on the Product Design team at Counsyl, and saw him ship a number of high-visibility product pilots. Alok has a wide range of abilities, and is able to craft everything from visuals to frontend code to customer research plans, happily taking on every challenge that come his way and tackled it with enthusiasm. Alok has the energy to jump into a nebulous project and ship a solution on schedule, combined with the patience to rapidly iterate and test many versions.

          My family immigrated to America when I was eleven years old. To me, America is a concept and a country. America allows you to be the best version of you. The only thing barring you from pursuing your dreams is yourself.

          In my personal and professional life, I look to great masters in art and science for inspiration. Leonardo da Vinci’s philosophy was that nature “expressed her purpose in the structure,” and it was precisely this observation that drove him to be exact and turned him towards mathematics, and a passion for the actual, which urged him to experiment. Leonardo Da Vinci made real the feeling that every individual carries in him or her unlimited potential and requires, not a lifetime of monastic devotion to one kind of work, but simply the proper environment in which he or she can unfold.

          As an entrepreneur, I am on the lookout for big ideas that change the world. Which is why I recommend reading "Abundance" by Peter Diamandis, one of my favorite books. Within the book's pages, you’ll find out how to save the world in the coming era of abundance that will replace eons of scarcity. It's that sort of thinking where you can see how I look toward tomorrow for opportunities.

          While I was born in Vancouver, I grew up in a small town close to New Delhi, India. I recall fondly learning to play Cricket and spending summers with my grandparents in the scenic north Indian town of Dehardun. My family eventually settled in sunny California, where I decided to attend UCLA (go Bruins!), earning a B.A. in Design.

          When I’m not working, I enjoy traveling. Next on my list is Morocco, Egypt and Turkey.
